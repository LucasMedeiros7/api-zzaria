# Pizza Ordering API (APIzzaria)

Welcome to the `APIzzaria` project! This application serves as a tool for frontend developers to easily help customers order pizzas through a JSON-based interface.

## Tasks to Complete
- [X] Make sure each new order gets a unique ID.
- [ ] Build the `/orders` section to display a list of all orders made.
- [ ] Set up the `/orders/:id` part to let us see details about a specific order.
- [ ] Upgrade the [POST] `/orders` feature, so customers can order multiple pizzas together.
- [ ] Go through the code, clean it up, and look for ways to make it even better.

### Ideas for Making Things Better

To make this project even more awesome, here are some ideas:

- Use a strong testing plan to catch and fix issues.
- Get GitHub Actions on board to handle repetitive tasks like building and testing.
- Wrap up the app in Docker to make it easier to put into action.
- Bring in Swagger documentation to provide a clear picture of how the API works.
- Build a user-friendly front-end to make ordering pizzas a breeze.
